The plugin has been reorganized for modularity and maintainability. Each system (kits, profiles, utilities, etc.) is structured into its own package, making it easy to contribute or customize.

## 📄 Information

This plugin was originally an unfinished KitPvP core made by **damt** for **RefineDevelopment**. After damt left the community, this project was abandoned. I've decided to fully recode and open source the plugin to help others and keep the project alive.
